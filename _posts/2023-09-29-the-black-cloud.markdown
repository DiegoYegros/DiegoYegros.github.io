In **The Black Cloud**, a harrowing sci-fi thriller, the unsettling discovery of a mysterious cosmic object sends shockwaves throughout the scientific community. Spotted by two teams—an American crew at Pasadena and their British counterparts at Cambridge—the object lurks at a staggering distance of 21.3 Astronomical Units from our solar system. 

### The Looming Threat

What makes this celestial intruder particularly unnerving is its deadly trajectory towards the Sun. This places it on a collision course with Earth's orbital path, casting a looming shadow of impending doom. Due to its immense density, the Cloud would effectively cut off sunlight, ushering in catastrophic consequences for all life forms on Earth.

## Survival of the Elite

Speculation runs rampant regarding the aftermath of this calamity. Kingsley, a member of the Royal Astronomical Society, postulates that survival would become an exclusive privilege. According to his conjecture, only high-profile individuals—such as politicians and celebrities—would secure spots in subterranean sanctuaries with stable temperatures. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of the population faces a grim fate, with a life expectancy reduced to a mere 16 months. The darkest period would be a month-long eclipse, where the Cloud obstructs the Earth-Sun axis, sealing humanity's doom.
